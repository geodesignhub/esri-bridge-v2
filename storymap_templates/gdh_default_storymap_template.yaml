# Update the content below with information specific to the current project. 
Background_Content: &Background |
  Region Council requested a community response for the Local Development Plan. Activities included:
  - Engaging professional landscape architects for Village A.
  - Community-organized groups identifying priority actions.
  - Workshops for community involvement.
Area_of_Interest_Content: &Area_of_Interest |
  One in-person interactive Geodesign workshop was organized with the community. Prior to the actual workshop, geosurveys were circulated to help prepare for the workshops. The surveys are anonymous, self-explanatory and were shared using social media and other mediums prior to the Geodesign workshops. Once enough responses were received, we conducted the in-person session to discuss the responses and facilitate negotiations to identify and prioritize draft actions. These main issues need to be addressed in the spatial management strategy response as part of the Local Area Plan.
Broader_Objectives_Content: &Objectives |
  Region Council requested a community response for the Local Development Plan. Activities included:
  - Engaging professional landscape architects for Village A.
  - Community-organized groups identifying priority actions.
  - Workshops for community involvement.
Compiling_Prior_Work_Content: &Compiling_Prior_Work |
  A lot of prior work has been conducted in the area, including dating back a few years by different people / groups, all of them are mainly in the form of PDFs. As a part of the preparatory activities, we identified key reports to digitize the following issues that were already identified based on the public consultation and preliminary surveys, and it gives a strong indication of the type of interventions to be expected.
GeosurveyContent: &Geosurvey |
  An anonymous geosurvey was conducted in the community prior to the community mapping event and the main goal of the survey was to collect map-based responses from the community. The survey was introduced and publicized via Facebook and online meetings.
GeosurveyContent2: &Geosurvey2 |
  The survey received several responses that included map geometry and text description as a part of the response. An initial review was conducted by the organizing committee in the lead up to the first workshop, after the event, we engaged an independent external review of the responses and the summary is detailed below.
Negotiation_Analysis_Content: &Negotiation_Analysis |
  When the teams made the selections, they made it independently and in discussions on their tables. The four teams built a synthetic strategy, and we can see that they have selected the same diagrams from the group available. Of note are diagrams selected by three or four teams (majority), this means that all the teams agree on these interventions independently and form the basis of the negotiations. 
Final_Design_Content: &Final_Design |
  After two in person events a strategy for the place was developed the section below shows a map and lists out the core ideas that have broad agreement within the community.
Theme_Action_Content: &Theme_Action |
  A theme by theme list of agreed projects and policies is below
Areas_No_Consensus_Content: &Areas_No_Consensus |
  There are some areas where the community could not agree on they are listed below
  The area in Kilcreggan village which is designated as a housing site in the LDP, there are considerations in the community to include more biodiversity and / or addition natural installations 
  There is a ongoing discussion about speed limits in the village and whether some or all parts of the village should be designated as a 20mph zone
  There is a open discussion around the location of the community garden, some sites have been identified
